==== BEEHIVE STAGE - VERSION 3.0.0 ====

Beehive was the first custom room for Smash Hit, started as an "expriment." It currently contains five new rooms and an exprimental boss room. This is the sources for version 3.0.0 (aka "Smash Hit Wiki Anniversary Edition").

=== HOW TO USE THESE FILES ===

Copy these files over the ones in the original APK in the right spots. I will not help you do this since I don't know what kind of enviorment you have or how you'd like to load the stage into the game.

=== SHARING AND FURTHER MODIFICATIONS ===

You may share and modify this level pack as you like. I would like credit for this mod and ask that any demo videos or images give credit in some way. This is not required. Assume the CC0 license for all files that do not come from Smash Hit. Thanks!

=== INCLUDED JSON DATA ===

This package contains a file by the name of `package.json`, which contains some basic information about the package. This may be useful if one were to write a tool to automate the "installation" of this pacakge.

=== BLENDER SOURCE FILES ===

In the blender folder, some source files are provided. These are the blender files used to design and generate the XML portion of the segment.

=== VERSIONING ===

As of version 3.0.0, this mod is now back to a semi-normal version scheme, despite the fact that 2.x was actually called B.x. Before B.5.0, this mod used a normal version scheme. For example, 0.4.0, 0.3.0, 0.3.1, etc. After B.5.0, the beehive room and the mod known as Knot's Custom Pack split into diffrent things, creating opprotunity for diffrent versions. To help aid the problem, major versions of Beehive use letters instad of numbers.
